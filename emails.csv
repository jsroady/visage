"<div>Hi [Name,fallback=],</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I am connecting with candidates, a lot of peole ask me why I joined Traction on Demand. I usually explain that there are a ton of reasons, but here are a couple things that really stood out to me that might interest you as well: We are a certified B Corp (we put profit on part with purpose), we care personally about our people, community, and our clients - which is why we put people first, we align all of our internal initiatives around our values. Plus, I also love that the team is all a little quirky, just like me.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I break it down to explain my feeling of starting at Traction on Demand, I immediately felt supported, energized, motivated, and excited by the vision, purpose, and work ethic of all of the people around me.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are looking for several Business Development Managers in Toronto to grow our team and sky rocket in to the future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I see your current job title is [candidate_job_title,fallback=<wbr />] at [candidate_employer,fallback=], I believe your experience could add a lot of value to our Business Development team.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
